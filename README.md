# Fine Tune LLAMA 2 With Custom Dataset Using LoRA And QLoRA Techniques


This code provides a detailed example of fine-tuning a LLaMA model using Hugging Face libraries. It starts by installing necessary packages like transformers, peft, and bitsandbytes, which facilitate model loading, quantization, and efficient parameter tuning. The script then defines various configurations, such as the model name, dataset, training parameters, and LoRA settings, to customize the training process. It loads a pre-trained model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face Hub, configures them for 4-bit quantization, and sets up a SFTTrainer for supervised fine-tuning using a specified dataset. After training, the model is saved and tested with a text generation pipeline to evaluate its performance. Finally, the fine-tuned model and tokenizer are pushed to the Hugging Face Hub for sharing and further use.

Ensures the datasets library is installed to load the dataset. Loads the training dataset from the Hugging Face Hub.Configures quantization settings for the model, loads the pre-trained base model and tokenizer, and sets up the model for fine-tuning. Sets up the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) configuration, which is used for efficient fine-tuning by modifying only certain parts of the model.
